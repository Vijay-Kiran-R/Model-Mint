## 🔗 Blockchain Integration

Model-Mint leverages blockchain technology to ensure the authenticity and ownership of your machine learning models. By uploading metadata to the blockchain, users can:

- **Establish Provenance**: Demonstrate the origin and creation details of the model.
- **Ensure Integrity**: Verify that the model has not been tampered with.
- **Facilitate Sharing**: Share models with confidence, knowing their ownership is verifiable.

*Note: Ensure you have the necessary blockchain credentials and configurations set up in the `web3app` module.*
